## ðŸ”§ **How It Works**

### **1. Data Processing:**
- Loads your CSV dataset with 10,000 samples
- Identifies columns: lambda (column 0), Lq (column 6), Wq (column 4)
- Cleans data by removing NaN and infinite values

### **2. Neural Network Architecture:**
- **Hidden Layers:** 256 â†’ 128 â†’ 64 neurons
- **Activation:** ReLU
- **Optimizer:** Adam with learning rate 0.001
- **Regularization:** L2 regularization (alpha=0.001)
- **Scaling:** MinMaxScaler for better performance

### **3. Training Process:**
- **80% training, 20% validation** split
- **Early stopping** to prevent overfitting
- **Cross-validation** for robust performance

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Results**

### **Real Data Examples:**
```
Row 500: lambda=0.7662, Lq=336.1373 â†’ Actual Wq=17.8587, Predicted Wq=21.7376 (21.72% error)
Row 5000: lambda=0.9557, Lq=2787.4433 â†’ Actual Wq=250.7641, Predicted Wq=207.1492 (17.39% error)
```

### **New Scenario Predictions:**
```
Low arrival rate (0.3), moderate queue (5) â†’ Predicted Wq = -0.3497
High arrival rate (0.9), short queue (3) â†’ Predicted Wq = 2.2913
Balanced scenario (0.5, 8) â†’ Predicted Wq = 0.2043
```
